ATMOS is an AI-powered energy intelligence platform designed to solve the intermittency problem of renewable energy. By predicting solar and wind generation with high precision, ATMOS enables Smart Homes and Industrial Factories to align their energy consumption with nature’s supply.

Unlike standard weather apps, ATMOS utilizes a Hybrid Data Architecture combining historical datasets, satellite APIs, and real-time IoT field sensors to achieve hyper-local accuracy.

"ATMOS is the bridge between the chaotic weather and the stable energy future."
